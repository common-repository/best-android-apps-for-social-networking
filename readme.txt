The current version of our app does not support categories. However we have received many requests and plan on implementing this in the near future.

Yes, but not in this version! We're working on a new plugin (soon to be released) that will allow users create a personalized "app list" using the RawApps.com directory for Android apps. From users will be able to share their "recommended apps" through the plugin.

= Do you have any plans to for an "Installed Apps" plugin? =

Yes. In addition to the features listed above we will be releasing a plugin that allows publisher to display what app they have installed on their Android devices through a simple Wordpress widget.
